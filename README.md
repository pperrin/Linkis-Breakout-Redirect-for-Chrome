# Linkis-Breakout-Redirect-for-Chrome
Chrome plug in so if you have the misfortune to be on a Linkis page, it will bounce you out to the actual page.

This plugin is in the chrome store https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/linkis-breakout-redirect/dpmganoapkolcdoinilblhnibmmgg

Most of the code came from an example post in the thread - http://superuser.com/questions/284110/redirect-urls-in-chrome - I changed it to only look for linkis links, then find the 'canonical' link, work out the original page URL and redirect to it.

Oh, the screenshot is my real project http:/www.radiofreeuk.org - so I get a bit of publicity maybe?

Enjoy.
